    This calculator determines the amount of water to add to decrease the oil/water ratio by increasing water volume (oil volume remains constant).
    
    The concept of decrease oil water ratio is to increase water volume in the system without any changes in oil volume to meet new oil water ratio.
    
    **Inputs:**  
    - Initial mud volume (bbl)  
    - % by volume oil (from retort analysis)  
    - % by volume water (from retort analysis)  
    - Desired oil/water ratio (e.g., 70 for 70/30)

    **Steps:**  
    1. Calculate initial oil and water volumes.  
    2. Calculate new total liquid volume so oil is the desired % of the new system.  
    3. Water added = new total liquid volume âˆ’ original liquid volume  
    4. For different total mud volumes, scale water added accordingly.
